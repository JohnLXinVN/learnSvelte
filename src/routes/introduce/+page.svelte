            <p>Here's our step-by-step guide to turning Black Friday weekend into a win.</p>
            <br />

            <p>Pile on the deals</p>
            <br />

            <p>Use these ideas to create irresistible offers for your clients:</p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Gift cards – over 50% of items bought during the Black Friday Weekend are Christmas gifts for others.
                Factor this into your promotions, then take it up a notch by giving customers a reason to return to you
                for a pre-Christmas treatment. For example, buy a £75 gift card, and get a complimentary festive
                manicure or trim.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
                Subscription memberships – create bulk packages that give customers hefty discounts; for instance, 12
                treatments for the price of 10. This kind of deal gives you a handy upfront payment and ensures return
                custom. It’s also perfect for self-gifting and gifts for others.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Top tip: with Fresha, you can set up Membership offers directly from your Business Settings.</p>
            <br />

            <p>
                Rewards for referrals – offer rewards to clients who refer a friend during Black Friday Weekend. It
                helps build loyalty and brings in business.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
                Offer bundles – pair under-performing products with more popular ones, showcased in a gift box or as a
                special gift package. For example, combine a £20 gift card with a 15% discount off a facial, or shampoo
                with 20% off a colour treatment.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
                Bargain baskets – some stock is harder to shift than others, so use Black Friday Weekend to get it
                moving. Find any low performing products and services, price them individually, and present them in an
                exclusive offers basket by your reception desk or as a feature in your window display.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
                Top tip: some ecommerce platforms let you track your sales by products and services. Fresha’s sales
                reports take this to another level, allowing you to filter by product, service, type, and date so you
                can spot trends, best sellers, and under-performers in an instant. Use it to identify which products you
                could put on offer for Black Friday Weekend.
